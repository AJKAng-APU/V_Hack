# V_Hack
## Overview

Thank you for checking out our project! Due to limitations with our Figma account (basic mode), we're unable to directly integrate with GitHub. We've provided two ways for you to view our design:

## Viewing Options

### PNG Design Files
We've included PNG exports of all our key design screens and components in this repository. These static images give you a comprehensive view of the visual design and layout of our interface. You can find these files in the design folder of this repository.

### Interactive Prototype
For a complete interactive experience, we've created a direct link to our Figma prototype. This allows you to see how the screens connect and experience the user flow as intended.

To access the interactive prototype:
1. Follow this link:([https://example.com/figma-prototype](https://www.figma.com/design/DiOZpoBzhBdvuzc7m8DRhy/YoungMen?node-id=0-1&m=dev&t=eJRQXv8AZYF4WN8E-1))
2. Click the start button at the top right corner
3. The prototype will open directly in presentation mode, ready for you to interact with
4. Click through the design elements to navigate between screens and test the functionality

The prototype demonstrates all the key interactions, transitions, and user flows that make up the complete experience. This gives you a much better understanding of how users would actually engage with our product than static images alone could provide.

## Additional Information

If you have questions about our design decisions or would like to provide feedback after reviewing the prototype, please feel free to reach out through the repository issues or contact our design team directly.

Thank you for taking the time to explore our design work!
