# V_Hack
Thank you for checking out our project! Due to limitations with our Figma account (basic mode), we're unable to directly integrate with GitHub. Instead, we've provided PNG exports of our design assets for your review.
Viewing the Design
The PNG files in this repository contain all the key screens and components of our design. To view them:

Navigate to the design-assets folder
Open any PNG file to view the corresponding screen or component
Refer to the file naming convention (screen-name.png) to understand what each file represents

Interactive Demo
While static images are helpful, we understand that seeing the interactive flow provides a much better understanding of the user experience. We've created a video demonstration that walks through the key interactions and flows of our design.
To watch the demo:

Follow this link: Design Demo Video
The video includes narration explaining our design decisions and interaction patterns

Future Updates
We're working on upgrading our design and implement it into real code in the future.
Thank you for your understanding and interest in our project!
